# Chapter1: What is OOP & Four Pillars of OOP in JavaScript üèõÔ∏è

This chapter focuses on the **Four Pillars of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** in JavaScript.  
We will explore Encapsulation, Abstraction, Inheritance, and Polymorphism with examples.

## What is OOP in JavaScript?

OOP is a programming paradigm where **code is organized using objects**, which can contain **data (properties)** and **behavior (methods)**.  
It allows:

- Reusable and modular code
- Modeling real-world entities as objects
- Using **constructor functions** or **ES6 classes** to create objects

## The Four Pillars of OOP

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Encapsulation

Bundling data and methods inside an object/class. Controls access to internal state with **private fields (`#field`)** and **getters/setters**.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Abstraction

Hiding unnecessary implementation details. Users interact with methods without needing to know internal workings.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Inheritance

Creating new classes from existing ones using `extends` and `super` to reuse behavior and avoid duplication.

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Polymorphism

Same method name behaves differently across objects or subclasses. Implemented via **method overriding** in child classes.
